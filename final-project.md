## Final Project

Write a brief description of what your app does.
Imagine that you are telling someone who doesn't
know about programming what your app does. Use this
in the presentation to explain to us what your app does.

Your app should at a minimum incorporate the following:

#### Required
- At least 3 relationships
- At least 2 CRUDs
- Relationships can be many-to-many or one-to-many
- Use devise to have a login system
- Have a working app!

#### Extra Points
- run rubocop on your code and fix all issues
- write test cases
- style your app so that it looks awesome
- use extra gems
